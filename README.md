# Usage

(1) Users may directly utilize the facebook or CA-AstroPh datasets available within the `Datasets`. Alternatively, they can download any dataset from https://snap.stanford.edu/index.html. It is important to note that the datasets are formatted as edge lists, which are text files structured as follows:

user1 user2

user3 user4

...

Comments, if any, are permitted at the beginning of the file and are denoted by a hash symbol (#).

(2) Replace the `file_path` in the Python script within the `Algorithms` directory with the path to the desired dataset you wish to analyze. Subsequently, execute the corresponding Python program to obtain the experimental results.
